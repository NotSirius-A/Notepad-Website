Website where users can create notes

Core functionalities/choices:
 - fast - least time to create notes
 - simple/clean UI
 - few features, just basic write/read/edit/delete notes
 - notes are persistent and tied to a user
 - individual notes can be shared between users, but only owner can edit/delete
 - works on mobile
+API to access notes. Not really needed, but i want to learn REST


Things to consider/ideas:
- built-in note encryption (i already have an algorithm in python on github)
- complex API
- HTML tags allowed inside notes
- auto deleting notes after some time
- custom user created categories for notes
