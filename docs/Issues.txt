Unfortunately (at the time of writing this), I don't know JavaScript, which generated some problems:
    - Instead of programming many django-views for functions like "delete" "view_entire" etc. I should've made an API and make API calls with JS
    - I don't yet know how to make the "Are you sure?" pop-up when user wants perform a permanent action, like note deletion


If this list is still here it means I didn't have time to take care of these issues:
    - No docstrings
    - Possibly SQL queries can be optimized (probably there are near-duplicate queries in some places, I should use django debug-toolbar)
    - Notepad app view functions don't follow DRY, CBV would probably work well here
    - Users can share a note multiple times to the same recipient
    - Users can share notes without direct consent from the reciever
    - Users can't unshare notes
    - User can share a note to themselves
    - CSS files can probably be optimzed, by joining some parts together (less requests)
    - Website security seems good, django handles most possible vulnerabilites by default,
      altough there probably are some Nginx settings that should be tweaked, for example directory indexing
    - No internationalization
